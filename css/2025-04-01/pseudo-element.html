    <h1>Pseudo Element</h1>
    <p>To display a star within a website's text, you need to use the relevant
        character entity reference. This is because the star is a special
        character. You can't just enter the star into the keyboard. Sure, you
        could copy and paste from another document but that's not a good idea
        (more on this below).</p>
